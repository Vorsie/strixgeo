## 0. Mission (owner's sentence)

Rewrite the interval layer to: "all you need is the ties, absence of ties and the litho."
Per gap, per side, per unit — from `effectiveCorr.ts`:
- **0-corr** → 8b-capped lens (min(0.45×gap, 2·thicknessM/gapWidthM via real alongM), band-clipped)
- **1-corr** → onlap tip 0.5 riding its (direct/derived/top-band) tie
- **2-corr** → band (mismatched formations → 8d midpoint quads)
- Terminations emitted BEFORE flood/residue closure.
- ruling-8e same-formation-tied enclosure = one face, no internal seams.
- ruling-6 substrate bounded above by its own tie; Q3 voids empty; ruling-5 top band.

Replace: the old `tileInterval` seam cascade + `routeLoneSidePinch`/`routeLoneStack` guard zoo
(`emitIntervals.ts`/`emitLonePinch.ts`/`emitLoneStack.ts`). Deletion is success.
`intersect.ts` UNTOUCHABLE (613-hole trap). READ-ONLY even here: v1 `utils/partitionFill/` package,
`partitionFill.ts`, committed `partitionFill.*.test.ts`.

## 2. Architecture (as-found, verified session 1)

Pipeline (design §3): `computeSectionFillV2(columns, edges, lensApexOverrides?, alongM?)`
→ `buildSectionInput` (sectionGeom.ts) → `emitCurves` → `buildArrangement` (intersect/dcel/faces)
→ `labelFaces` → `slice`/`sliceAnnulus` → `SectionRegion[]`.

`emitCurves` order (emitCurves.ts):
1. `emitColumnVerticals` — per-unit column verticals (vertex at every contact)
2. `emitSurfaceCurves` — top-band polyline per gap (ruling 5-revised, `firstLithoTopElev`)
3. `resolveTies` + `pruneCrossingTies` → `activeTies` (ResolvedTie, per-gap/side/unitIndex) → tie curves
4. `emitSubstrateBridges` (jump ties) → `bridgeAnchored`
5. `emitIntervalCurves` (emitIntervals.ts) — **THE INTERVAL TILER being rewritten** — untied-unit
   vacancy closure via seams; routes into `emitLonePinch`/`emitLoneStack`/`emitSharedContactOnlap`/
   `emitSurfaceOnlap`
6. `emitEnclosedLensCurves` (emitLenses.ts) — enclosed lenses as holes-in-matrix
7. `emitBottomTieSubstrate` — flat-floor deep-to-deep sub-TD

**The corr arithmetic** (`effectiveCorr.ts`) is ONE source of truth, shared engine+gate:
`effectiveCorrForSide(gapIndex, side, col, facing, left, right, activeTies): EffectiveCorr[]`
returns per-unit {topTied, baseTied, corr}. THIS is the driver the rewrite must feed the tiler from.

**`edgedLayerIds`** (sectionGeom.ts:185) — section-wide `Set<string>` of every layerId in ANY edge.
Used in `extractEnclosedLenses` to skip extracting a tied unit as a lens. **THE SESSION-1 TARGET:**
this is TOO COARSE — a unit edged in gap N (adjacent) is wrongly blocked from lensing in gap M≠N.
The doc's fix path = per-gap `edgedLayerIds`, extract at the interval level not the column pre-pass.

**Enclosed-lens extraction** (`extractEnclosedLenses`, sectionGeom.ts:262) — per-COLUMN, before gaps:
a unit k with above.formation==below.formation!=k.formation, un-edged (section-wide), merges
above+below into one matrix unit, records the lens in `col.enclosedLenses`. Emitted into BOTH
adjacent gaps by `emitEnclosedLensCurves` (guarded by `facingCarriesMatrix`).

## 3. The 19 residual conformance violations (from diag_conformance.json / doc §4 FINAL SHAPES)

Grouped by the doc's FINAL SHAPES row (the fix-path taxonomy):

**(a) no-emit pair** — routeLoneStack skips (enclosing SILT-below is EDGED/base-tied):
- CS1 g20 ZAND el[8.88,9.23] (1corr, both-tied, absent)
- CS1 g21 ZAND el[8.88,9.23] (1corr, both-tied, absent)

**(b) lens-edged trio** — minority TIED IN ADJACENT gap, section-wide edgedLayerIds excludes it,
but per-side rule says it must lens 0.45 in THIS gap:  ← **SESSION-1 PRIMARY TARGET**
- CS1 g3 SILT [left] el[0.232,0.665] (1corr top=true base=false, absent)
- CS1 g22 ZAND [left] el[9.83,10.42] (0corr, absent)
- CS2 g21 SILT [left] el[-3.99,-3.67] (1corr top=true base=false, absent)

**(c) boundary/mixed trio** — enclosed by DIFFERENT formations above/below (not same-formation lens):
- Tie-10 g0 ZAND [right] el[5.73,6.44] (0corr, absent)  [also appears as CS1 g5 ZAND same elev]
- CS1 g5 ZAND [left] el[5.73,6.44] (1corr top=true base=true, absent)
- CS1 g7 SILT [right] el[9.29,9.85] (0corr, absent; faces 2-unit shallow col → §8-Q3 substrate entangle)

**(d) untied same-formation full-widths (ruling-8 residual — gate flags CORRECTLY, NOT engine defects):**
- Tie-10 g0 SILT/ZAND full-width (1corr, top-only / base-only) — opposing 8b lenses until owner ties
- Tie-12 g0 SILT [right] el[9.24,10.65] (1corr base-tied, full-width band)
- CS1 g18 VEEN [left] / ZAND [right] full-width (0corr / 1corr)
- CS1 g19 KLEI [left] full-width (1corr)
- CS1 g22 SILT [left] full-width band (0corr + 1corr)
- CS2 g13 SILT [left/right] el[-5.31..-4.42]/[3.77..5.27] (1corr base/both, full-width band)

**8b reach cap (advisory 2):** the 2 advisory `0corr-reach-exceeds-cap` render at 0.5 INTERIOR via a
NON-`isLens` lone-side path (engine/gate routing disagreement). Prior attempts to shrink the isLens
apex REGRESSED the counter (nearer-apex re-trace, doc §4). Needs the lone-side routing restructure.

## 4. Session-1 plan & progress

**Priority 1 (DONE):** wrote this file.
**Priority 2 (IN PROGRESS):** per-gap `edgedLayerIds` + per-gap/per-side termination emitter for the
lens-edged class (b). Prove on Tie-4 + CS1 g3.
**Priority 3 (NOT STARTED):** terminations-first for two-sided intervals, section by section (Ties first).

### Progress log
- 2026-07-15 session 1. Read design doc §2/§4/§8 fully, sectionGeom/effectiveCorr/emitCurves/
  emitLenses/emitIntervals/emitIntervalLenses, conformance gate + classify. Confirmed baseline
  5/14/0=19 matches doc §4 FINAL SHAPES row; holes 0/0/0; CS1 7/7; v1 90/90; tsc clean.
- **Priority 2 DELIVERED (foundation):** `partitionFillV2/edgedLayers.ts` — `buildEdgedLayers(columns, edges)`
  → `{ sectionWide: Set, inGap(layerId, gapIndex): boolean }`. The per-gap edged predicate the
  lens-edged fix needs. Unit test `partitionFillV2.edgedLayers.test.ts` (5 cases, GREEN) pins the
  rule: a layerId edged only in gap N returns false for gap M; jump edges belong to no gap.
- **RED gate landed (session-2 target):** `partitionFillV2.lensEdged.test.ts` (describe.skip — keeps
  the suite green; un-skip in session 2 to drive red→green). Encodes: CS1 g22 SILT + CS2 g21 SILT
  must render lens/onlap (not band/absent). VERIFIED genuinely RED against current engine:
  CS1 g22 SILT → `band`, CS2 g21 SILT → `absent`.
- Bash `git`/`rm` + PowerShell DENIED in this env; only non-git bash + file tools. Multi-env-var
  test runs also trip the matcher — run one env var at a time (CS1_GATE=1 / HOLES_DIAG=1 / SHAPE_AUDIT=1),
  no-env multi-file batches are fine. Orchestrator commits + does file deletes.
- Throwaway probe test neutralised to `describe.skip` no-op (couldn't delete): file
  `partitionFillV2.throwaway_probe.diag.test.ts` + `scripts/throwaway_probe_*.mjs` are stubs —
  orchestrator should `rm` them.

### Findings (mechanism, exact — from real-data probes)
**The lens-edged class root, confirmed on real data (CS1 g22, CS2 g21, CS1 g3):**
- `sectionGeom.extractEnclosedLenses` runs PER-COLUMN with the section-wide `edgedLayerIds` set.
  A minority edged in ANY gap (even the ADJACENT one) is skipped → stays in `col.units` → drops to
  the interval-level flood → absorbed by its same-formation enclosing flood → renders band/absent.
- CS1 g22 LEFT stack: u0 ZAND, u1 SILT, u2 ZAND, u3 SILT. u1 SILT (enclosed ZAND/ZAND) and
  u2 ZAND (enclosed SILT/SILT) are BOTH 0-corr in gap 22 but edged in gap 21 → extraction empty
  (`L.enclosedLenses=[]`) → u1 renders `band`, u2 renders `absent`. CORRECT: both are 0.45 lenses.
- CS2 g21 LEFT: u6 SILT el[-3.99,-3.67] is 1-corr in gap 21 (top-tied) but edged-g20 → absent.
  CORRECT: onlap tip 0.5 riding its top tie.
- CS1 g3 LEFT: u3 SILT el[0.232,0.665] is 1-corr in gap 3 (top-tied HERE) enclosed by ZAND/ZAND
  → extraction skips it (lensEdged section-wide) → absent. CORRECT: onlap riding its top tie.
  NOTE: doc grouped CS1 g3 as "tied in the adjacent gap" but the data shows it's tied in THIS gap
  (top) — it's still the same fix (per-gap extraction that lets a tied-here-as-onlap minority
  terminate instead of being absorbed by the ZAND flood). Trust the data over the doc grouping.
- The interval-level `emitIntervalLenses.extractEnclosedLenses` DOES run per-gap-per-side on
  `IntervalUnit[]`, BUT it BAILS ("residual multi-formation → return whole stack full-width")
  when the interbedded residual is >1 formation (CS1 g22 u1/u2 leave ZAND+SILT residual). That
  bail is why the flood swallows them. This is the doc's "flood-absorbs-the-lens wall" +
  "splitAnnulus fires only on holes>0" class — the notch face rides the column edge (holes=0).

### Engine wiring (as-found, for session 2)
- `emitCurves` order (emitCurves.ts): verticals → surface/top-band → ties → substrate bridges →
  `emitIntervalCurves` (the tiler) → `emitEnclosedLensCurves` (holes) → `emitBottomTieSubstrate`.
- `emitEnclosedLensCurves` (emitLenses.ts) emits from `col.enclosedLenses` (section-wide extraction)
  into BOTH adjacent gaps, guarded by `facingCarriesMatrix`. This is the natural home for the
  per-gap extraction: session 2 replaces the `col.enclosedLenses` source with a per-gap extraction
  driven by `buildEdgedLayers.inGap(layerId, gapIndex)` (0-corr → lens here; 1-corr → onlap here).
- `tileInterval` (emitIntervals.ts) calls `extractEnclosedLenses(leftUnits, ..., leftFacing)` per
  interval — the bail path. The two-sided restructuring (priority 3) drives this from
  `effectiveCorrForSide` instead of the seam/meetFraction model.

### Next steps (exact, for session 2)
1. **Wire per-gap extraction for the lens-edged class.** In `emitEnclosedLensCurves` (or a new
   sibling `emitPerGapMinorities.ts`), for each gap+side: find enclosed minorities on the column
   (same-formation above+below != own) that are NOT `inGap(layerId, gapIndex)` per `buildEdgedLayers`,
   AND whose `facingCarriesMatrix`. Emit: 0-corr → `emitOne` 0.45 lens (existing path); 1-corr →
   an onlap tip 0.5 riding its tie (reuse `emitSharedContactOnlap`/`emitSurfaceOnlap` machinery).
   CRITICAL: the matrix must be a continuous band around the minority for the hole to trace — but
   the section-wide extraction already merged the OTHER (un-edged) minorities. For an edged minority
   still IN `col.units`, the arrangement must see the enclosing matrix continuous ACROSS the minority
   in THIS gap. This is where holes>0 risk lives (`splitAnnulus` only fires on holes>0; a notch on
   the column edge is holes=0). Verify holes 0/0/0 after EVERY change; if the notch merges, route it
   through `slice.splitAnnulus` / the annulus path (doc §4 Milestone-2 fix pattern:
   `extractEnclosedLenses` body-guard was relaxed + `sliceAnnulus` strip-clip-first).
2. **Un-skip `partitionFillV2.lensEdged.test.ts`**, drive it green. Then re-add the 3rd case (CS1 g3
   SILT onlap) once the 0-corr lens cases pass.
3. **Regression-guard:** after each change re-run conformance (target: 5/14/0 → drops as cases land),
   holes 0/0/0, CS1 7/7, all 6 shape gates, sliceAnnulus, v1 90/90, tsc. The doc warns the
   `routeLoneStack`/extraction change touches 32 currently-OK cases — guard each.
4. **Then priority 3** (two-sided terminations-first): drive `tileInterval` from `effectiveCorrForSide`
   per gap per side — 2→band, 1→onlap tip 0.5, 0→8b-capped lens, BEFORE flooding; re-close residue.
   This is the (a) no-emit pair, (d) untied-pair, and (c) boundary/mixed classes. Section by section,
   Tie-sections first. This is the big restructuring `tileInterval`/`meetFraction` replacement.
